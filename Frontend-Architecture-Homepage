Architecture and Workflow in React
You are requested to open the figma model for understanding this document
There will be many nested divisions made inside
div->Division
Nomenclature -> every div will have separate naming related to its component for easy code
handling and styling purpose. eg-> Home_Outer, after nesting inside (Home_Outer_search)
something like this. (Very important otherwise whole code structure would go down)
Div outer for safety and changes will be there in every single component.
Will take a separate session on file handling in React.
1). Navbar at top -> React Component-> Div outer for safety and changes, then 2 div inside
outer div(left div and right div) right div with unordered list, inside unordered list will have Li tags
for nav links.
2). Umbrella image and search bar-> React Component ->Background color light blue, Div outer
for safety and changes, then 2 div inside outer div for left and right part handling, using
usestates for user entry in search bar.
3). Our Mission-> React Component -> Outer Div, 2 div inside outer div for left and right part
handling,
Left part with video link and image, right part with our mission text.
4). Testimonials-> React Component -> Outer div, Mid div inside outer div which contains
testimonial, and experience boxes, then 2 div inside mid div for top and bottom part.
Bottom part contains again 2 div with left and right experience box handling.
5). Video Links-> React Component -> Outer div, Mid div inside outer div which contains upper
text,mid text and images with video links then 2 div inside mid div for top and bottom part.
Bottom part contains a loop for video rendering.
6). Bottom search bar-> React component -> background umbrella image, outer div, single div
for all the text and search bar.
7). Footer-> React component -> Outer div, 2 div inside outer, 3 divs inside Outer_top div,
leftmost for follow us and text, mid div for quick links,rightmost for Reach us section.
Outer_bottom div handles terms and condition text.
8). Disclaimer -> React Component -> Single div for whole text
You might not understand this but I will make you go through just in one session .
